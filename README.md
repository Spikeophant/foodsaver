A web based app to help keep track of what you have on hand to cook with, what you can make with it.  You can search recipes, find new dishes.  Save recipes, add your own.  Generate a shopping list based on the recipes you want to cook, and what you have on hand.  NOTE: This project is a work in progress currently.

## Installation

Currently we support self hosted as well as heroku deployments.  If you deploy to Heroku ensure you have a JawsDB MySQL instance setup.  Otherwise you will need to configure a .env file based on your env and mysql setup.  Once that is done, run npm install to install the dependencies, and start the server with npm run start.

## Usage

Once deployed you'll be able to navigate from the homepage wherever you need, if you'd like to use our demo deployment, it can be viewed at https://rocky-falls-73820.herokuapp.com/
